## Question 1

For linear regression, the model is $f_{x,b}(x) = w*x + b$ 

Which of the following are the inputs, or features, that are fed into the model and with which the model is expected to make a prediction?

- m
- **x**
  - The x, the input features, are fed into the model to generate a prediction $f_{x,b}(x)$
- (x,y)
- w and b

## Question 2
For linear regression, if you find parameters w and b so that J(w,b) is very close to zero, what can you conclude?

- **The selected values of the parameters w and b cause the algorithm to fit the training set really well.**
  - When the cost is small, this means that the model fits the training set well.
- The selected values of the parameters w and b cause the algorithm to fit the training set really poorly.
- This is never possible -- there must be a bug in the code.
