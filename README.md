# [Machine-Learning-Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. This beginner-friendly program will teach you the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications. 

This Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.

It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

By the end of this Specialization, you will have mastered key concepts and gained the practical know-how to quickly and powerfully apply machine learning to challenging real-world problems. If youâ€™re looking to break into AI or build a career in machine learning, the new Machine Learning Specialization is the best place to start.

## [Course 2 - Advanced Learning Algorithms](./Course2/)
### [Week 1: Neural Networks](./Course2/Week1/)
This week, you'll learn about neural networks and how to use them for classification tasks. You'll use the TensorFlow framework to build a neural network with just a few lines of code. Then, dive deeper by learning how to code up your own neural network in Python, "from scratch". Optionally, you can learn more about how neural network computations are implemented efficiently using parallel processing (vectorization).

Learning Objectives
- Get familiar with the diagram and components of a neural network
- Understand the concept of a "layer" in a neural network
- Understand how neural networks learn new features.
- Understand how activations are calculated at each layer.
- Learn how a neural network can perform classification on an image.
- Use a framework, TensorFlow, to build a neural network for classification of an image.
- Learn how data goes into and out of a neural network layer in TensorFlow
- Build a neural network in regular Python code (from scratch) to make predictions.
- (Optional): Learn how neural networks use parallel processing (vectorization) to make computations faster.

### [Week 2: Neural network training](./Course2/Week2/)
This week, you'll learn how to train your model in TensorFlow, and also learn about other important activation functions (besides the sigmoid function), and where to use each type in a neural network. You'll also learn how to go beyond binary classification to multiclass classification (3 or more categories). Multiclass classification will introduce you to a new activation function and a new loss function. Optionally, you can also learn about the difference between multiclass classification and multi-label classification. You'll learn about the Adam optimizer, and why it's an improvement upon regular gradient descent for neural network training. Finally, you will get a brief introduction to other layer types besides the one you've seen thus far.
